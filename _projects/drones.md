Drones fascinate me because they allow me to see the world from a different perspective. It's always been a dream of mine to be able to fly, and drones give me that ability.

In the years since I've started flying drones, there's been a real crackdown on where you can fly them, and I don't get a chance to take mine out as muc as I'd like to. 

Here are a few shots that have stuck with me over the years
