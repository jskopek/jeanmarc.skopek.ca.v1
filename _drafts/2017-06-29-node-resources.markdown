I recently decided to pick Node.JS as the backend for a new project I've been working on. The experience has been amazing so far; the community has evolved so much in the past three years!

There's a lot to learn, so I've decided to put together a list of resources that I've found useful. This is primarily for my own benefit, but perhaps some other people will find it useful.

# Database

- [knex](http://knexjs.org/): A 'batteries included' database interaction library that supports multiple databases. Includes tools to build queries, run migrations, and do pretty much everything
- [bookshelf](http://bookshelfjs.org/): An ORM build on top of Knex
- [pg-promise](https://github.com/vitaly-t/pg-promise): A clean library that handles postgres database connections

# Authentication

- [Passport JS](http://passportjs.org/): An authentication library
- [Node, passport, and postgres tutorial](http://mherman.org/blog/2016/09/25/node-passport-and-postgres/#.WVVjoYjyvAQ): Really well-written tutorial walking through a clean passport authentication setup
