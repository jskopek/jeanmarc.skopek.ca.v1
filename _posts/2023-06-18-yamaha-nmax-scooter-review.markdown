The Yamahah NMax is one of the most common scooters on the road in Bali, and there's a good reason for it. This thing looks and feels like a motorcycle, and gives you tons of space to spread out and get comfortable on longer drives. It's makes for a great driving experience, but there are some tradeoffs that are worth considering

# The Good
**Design** is a subjective thing, but I think the NMax looks great. It's got an agreesive look that doesn't hide its size, width wide hips and a logo that is practically horizontal. I like how Yamaha highlights the excellent rear shocks.

The handlebars are familiar to anyone who has used a scooter before, with the turn signals, lights, and horn controlled by your left hand and the starter button on the right. My rental had thick handlebars that felt a lot more comfortable than other scooters I have used.

The screen is excellent - big, bright, and with lots of information. In addition to the usual speed, gas, odometer readings you can also see fuel consumption and a clock. It's easy to see the speed at a glance when you are riding. The lights are fantastic - the best of any scooter I have used so far.

Performance on the NMAX is the best of any scooter I've driven so far. It accelerates quickly, feels smooth, and has a good engine sound. The brakes are fantastic, also the best I've used on a scooter. Fuel consumption doesn't seem to be too badly affected by the bigger engine, but you will need to choose a higher-tier 98 octane Pertamax Turbo or Pertamax fuel instead of the cheaper - and ubiquitous - Pertamini that many other scooters can use.

In case it's not obvious, I really like this scooter. There are a few downsides, however, that make it really hard for me to pick this as my go-to scooter.

# The Bad
The biggest issue for me - and ultimately my dealbreaker - **is the size**. This may not be an issue depending on your needs, but I found it tricky and clumsy to park more often than not. In places where I could just turn the wheel and go on other scooters, I found that I had to do a back-and-fourth dance with the NMax. I'm not sure if this is because of the turning radius or the size, but it was enough that I found going back to a smaller scooter to be a breath of fresh air.

There's also the issue of weight. The NMax is one of the heaviest scooters out there, at 127kg dry without fuel.

This is a subjective thing, but I really dislike the center gas tank layout. It has advantages - the gas is lower which helps with stability - but I find the disadvantages to be too much. My biggest issue is that it makes **storing bags on the front very tricky**. Some models can be retrofitted with a hook, but other models - including the one I borrowed - do not have this ability. Even with the ones that do, having the center gas tank makes it harder to store things in front. The center tank also makes getting on the NMax is a little different than on a compact scooter, as you have to swing your legs over it; it doesn't take long to get used to it, but the first few times I tried it I felt pretty clumsy.

# Overall
The NMax is incredibly popular in Indonesia, and for good reason. I'm a big fan of the design, with wide hips and a horizontal logo that speaks to its strong presence. The rear shocks are a highlight, and the handlebars feel comfortable and familiar to anyone who has driven a scooter before. The performance is impressive, boasting swift acceleration and smooth handling. However, the larger engine does necessitate a higher-tier fuel, which is a trade-off to consider.

However, my experiences with the NMax wasn't all positive. While it's great on the open road, the scooter's large size and weight often made it awkward to park and maneuver in tight spaces and I found myself missing the agility of smaller scooters like the Vario or Scoopy. I also found the centrally located gas tank to be a dealbreaker; while it contributes to stability, it greatly affected storage on the scooter and made mounting and dismounting a bit cumbersome. In summary, the Yamaha NMax is an excellent ride with a few trade-offs that potential riders should consider.
