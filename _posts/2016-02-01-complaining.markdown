I'm staying at an incredible resort in Vietnam right now. The common area has a beautiful pool with plenty of lounge seats all around it. I'm sitting in one at the moment, watching a plastic wrapper float around on top of the water. The first time I saw it, I felt annoyed. I'm spending a large amount of money (by my standards) to stay here - how can they be ok with a plastic wrapper floating around the pool?

As soon as that feeling registered to me, I felt shame. If I were staying at a hostel, this pool would be an incredible luxury. A piece of plastic floating around on top would not be annoying - after all, the pool shouldn't even exist!

I wonder how billionaires feel when they notice the floor of their mega yachts are dirty. Do they get that same feeling of annoyance? Does being pampered mean that you have more things to complain about?
