The May Long weekend loomed on the horizon, and we decided we should do something special to celebrate our three days off.

I think we did pretty good.

The drive up from Vancouver is long, but the scenery on the way is very pretty.

And getting into the mountains as well.

The whisky doubled as a G-force meter.

{% include video.html title="Driving Deer" %}

We saw a bunch of deer on the way up, including one that charged the truck kamikaze style. This one knew what was up though.

{% include video.html title="Driving Back 1" %}

The roads up are very bumpy; an all-wheel drive car is recommended, but a lot of people make the trek in 2wd cars. A stranger's car lost its oil pan on the way up, which sounds rough.

The last 75km up is on a logging road, and the final 10km of that is on a very rough unmaintained road. The logging road is plowed in the winter, but the final 10km is left alone. We heard from people with heavy duty trucks that it's impossible to drive more than a few feet up in the winter; expect to snowshoe or snowmobile your way up if you're visiting in the winter.

{% include video.html title="Camping Tent" %}

The campsites are well laid out and very comfortable. We paid $15 per night per car, which works out to an incredible deal. For your $15 you get unlimited access to the hot springs, a campsite with fire pit, and outhouses. Some campsites even have benches and cooking grills.

We arrived at 11AM on a Saturday morning and claimed one of the last remaining campsites, but that may have been more because of the May long weekend holiday.

{% include video.html title="Camping Axe" %}

There's something incredibly satisfying about swinging an axe down on a cutting block. Here's hoping that's not just some latent psycopatheic tendencies.

{% include video.html title="Campfire Day" %}

The unusually wet start to the year meant that we could make fires without any worry. We brought our own wood, but you can buy a wheelbarrow full for $15.

{% include video.html title="Alecia Reading Fire" %}

Alecia made a huge dent in this book over the weekend, figuratively speaking. I'm sure she also got it a little dirty.

{% include video.html title="Camping Cooking Combined" %}

Fred and Alecia showing us what true campfire cooking looks like.

{% include video.html title="Camping Cribbage 2" %}

A lot of cribbage was played. I discovered I need to learn basic addition.

{% include video.html title="Camping Jess Jamie" %}

There was also a lot of hanging out.

{% include video.html title="Camping Morgan Kiss" %}

And a lot of looking at trees.

{% include video.html title="Hiking" %}

There aren't any designated hiking trails, but the area is fun to explore and easy to navigate. There were signs are recent bear activity, so you don't want to be a complete idiot about it.

{% include video.html title="Hot Springs Discovery 3" %}

The hot springs are fed from a series of natural streams. These are really, really, really hot. I couldn't keep my hand under this stream for more than a second.

{% include video.html title="Hot Springs Pan Down" %}

The hot springs themselves are really, really beautiful. The hot streams meet the freezing river below and pool into a series of natural baths. Each area is a different temperature, so you can go from chilly to charred and everything in between.

There's very little sign of human meddling. The only foreign object is a small changing area on the edge of the pools.

{% include video.html title="Hot Springs Pan Out" %}

Tea candles and lamps are scattered among the rocks, and the springs look magical when the stars come out and the candles are lit.

{% include video.html title="Hot Springs Relax" %}

It can get pretty busy in the evening, but we never found it hard to find space. The pools clear out during the day, which makes for some pretty relaxing times.

{% include video.html title="Hot Springs Water 2" %}

The Sloquet hot springs are pretty incredible, and well worth the 6 hour drive. It's hard to believe that something like this can happen naturally, but nature can be pretty amazing. I'd love to know how many generations have dipped their toes into the water after a long hard day.
