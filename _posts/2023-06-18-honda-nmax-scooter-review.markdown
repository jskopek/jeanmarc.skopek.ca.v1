The Honda Vario is a ubiquitous scooter, and you will see it almost everywhere on the road in Bali. There's a good reason for this! It's a cheap, fun, economical, and small scooter that does everything you need in a scooter. It's also been around for over a decade, so there are plenty of options to suit all budgets and needs.

# Pros
The Vario small size, light weight, and decent horsepower makes it the most fun scooter I've drive in Bali. Riding this thing feels a little like driving a small sports car. The highest tier 160cc model with ABS brakes offers a ton of performance in a very lightweight package.

Parking this scooter is a breeze, as it getting it in and out of small spaces. It's got a short wheelbase, which makes it easy to move around things, and the light weight makes it a lot easier to lift the front or back up if you come back to it only to find it stuck in a tangle of other parked scooters.

The front hook is very useful for storing backpacks or bags. It's also nice to be able to readjust your feet while you are on the road

The price is fantastic for what you get. Modern Varios can be had with keyless start, LCD gauge clusters, and LED headlights for 18-22M. This price substantially undercuts the Yamaha Lexi and NMax

The Vario is an institution, with models dating back to 2009 still available on the used and rental market. It can be serviced anywhere and has tons of used and aftermarket parts. It is also available in a number of trims offering all sorts of features, with 125cc, 150cc, and 160cc engine variations.

# Cons
My biggest issue with the Vario is the size, which is a little too compact for my 6"2' frame. I can just fit my legs inside, but the clearance between my knees and the front of the scooter is minimal. When I go over bumps or ruts in the road, my knees often bump against the front and over time it can start to get pretty frustrating. I normally ride with my legs at a 45 degree angle sticking out, but this can be pretty uncomfortable during long rides or in the rain. This is pretty much the only issue that I have with this scooter

I find the design of earlier model Varios to be a little bland, although the 2018+ models got a pretty major redesign that I find looks a lot more agressive and nice

The pre-2015 model headlights can be pretty terrible. The 2017 model I drove had substantially better headlights, although not nearly as good as the NMax

# Overall
I really like the Vario scooter, and came close to choosing it as my daily driver. Unfortunately, its small size makes it hard to recommend for taller folks over 6ft. If you can fit in it and like the styling, it's an easy recommendation.
