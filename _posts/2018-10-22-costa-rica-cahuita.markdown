Cahuita National Park is a beautiful and easily accessible park on the Pacific side of Costa Rica. The entrace of the park is at the border of the town of Cahuita, which makes it very easy to access. Entrance is by donation, although the recommended donation amount is $10USD/pp.

The trail at the start of Cahuita National Park is sandy and runs along a beach. The start of the trail is nice, but it was quite absent of animals. This part of the trail is quite busy, and all the human traffic likely keeps the animals away.

Some creatures don't fear humans. These white-headed capuchin monkeys played in the trees above us.

The sky had been looking threatening all afternoon, and as we made our way into the jungle the rain started to come down.

We came accross howler monkeys inside the jungle. They let out huge cries as the rain started to fall. We were surprised by how small they were when we finally saw them; their shreiks made them sound massive.

It's incredible to watch the monkeys as they they move around the treetops.
